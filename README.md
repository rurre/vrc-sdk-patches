This repository includes a bunch of VRC SDK Harmony patches.

### Anonymize Avatar Name
This patch automatically anonymizes the avatar thumbnail name, which is where apps such as VRCX grab the avatar name from. 

The patch needs to be enabled in the settings before it'll do anything. You can access the settings at `Tools` > `Pumkin` > `VRC SDK Patches`.
Settings include a list of names you can add for the patch to pick from at random. If no names are added, the avatar will be named `Avatar`.
