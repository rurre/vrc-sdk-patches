This repository includes a bunch of VRC SDK Harmony patches.

### Anonymize Avatar Name
This patch automatically anonymizes the avatar thumbnail name, which is where apps such as VRCX grab the avatar name from. This happens when you **update the thumbnail through the SDK** (which includes uploading a new avatar).

The patch needs to be enabled in the settings before it'll do anything. You can access the settings at `Tools` > `Pumkin` > `VRC SDK Patches`.
Settings include a list of names you can add for the patch to pick from at random. If no names are added, the avatar will be named `Avatar`.

**⚠️ Please note that if someone is in the same instance as you, they will be able to see your real avatar name, both in VRCX and VRChat! ⚠️**
